# Hytale Decode Server GUI

A user-friendly desktop application designed to decode, decompress, and inspect data blobs, which are commonly used in network communications, such as those from Hytale game servers. This tool provides a simple interface to handle base64 encoded and zlib compressed data, with built-in JSON formatting and syntax highlighting for easy analysis. It is particularly useful for decoding the base64 string generated by the 'Online Play' feature in Hytale's singleplayer mode.

## Features

- **Base64 Decoding**: Automatically handles base64 encoded strings, including fixing common padding issues.
- **Zlib Decompression**: Intelligently attempts to decompress the decoded data using various zlib window bit settings.
- **JSON Pretty-Printing**: If the decoded data is JSON, it is automatically formatted with indentation to improve readability.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: The JSON output is color-coded to distinguish between keys, strings, numbers, and boolean/null values, making it easier to inspect the data structure.
- **Error Handling**: Displays clear error messages if the input is invalid or if any step of the decoding process fails.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Tkinter, it runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.

## How to Use

1.  **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    python decode_gui.py
    ```
2.  **Input Data**: Paste your base64 encoded string into the "Base64 Input" text area.
3.  **Decode**: Click the "Decode" button.
4.  **View Output**: The decoded, decompressed, and formatted data will appear in the "Output" area below. If the output is valid JSON, it will be pretty-printed and highlighted.
